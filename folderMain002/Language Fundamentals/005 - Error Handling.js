/***** Error Handling *****/

// Throw and catch errors to fail or recover if possible

// Some errors can'be avoided that's beyond developer's control
// as user input errors => e.g. user enters text like 'hi' instead of a number
// as network erros => e.g. server is offline

try {
    // just put block codes that you want to lookout error's
} catch (error) {
    // this is where you recover or fallback the error
}
